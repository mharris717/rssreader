Some things I'm not in love with.

Somewhat awkward mix of ajax and non-ajax elements.
If multiple users have the same feed, they don't share anything in the database, and the feed is retrieved N times.   
Test coverage should be much better.
Posts could disappear from left column when read with ajax.
